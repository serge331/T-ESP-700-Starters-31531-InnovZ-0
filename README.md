## About The Project
***Theme :*** Improvement of crop monitoring and management techniques adapted to the different needs of the agricultural sector
###
***Project name :*** **Agri-Tech** by InnovZ
###
"***Agri-Tech***" is a project aiming at the creation of a web and mobile application to collect environmental data necessary for the good conservation of a crop.
###
It is based on the following factors: 
  * temperature
  * humidity
  * light
  * air quality

A scan is also performed to determine whether the room meets or exceeds the following requirements :
  * presence of openings for natural light
  * windows
  * presence of ventilation ducts
  * thermal insulation
  * the general condition of the structure
  
### Why choose Agri-Tech ?
"***Agri-tech***", closer to the underclass, closer to those manufacturers forgotten by the giants of the world. We will work to recondition the existing and adapt it to the needs.
